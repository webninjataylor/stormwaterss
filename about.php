She received her B.S. and M.S. degrees in Biological Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2007 and 2008, respectively and her M.S. project included designing, constructing and monitoring two stormwater practices, a bioretention cell and an infiltration trench. Kathy joined North Carolina State University’s stormwater research team in 2008 as an extension associate under the direction of Dr. Bill Hunt, where she designed, installed and monitored numerous stormwater practices, including bioretention, permeable pavement, wetlands, level spreaders, rain gardens, and rainwater harvesting systems. Kathy received her Professional Engineer’s license in 2011 and began her venture as a private consultant.  Concurrently, Kathy began her pursuit of a doctorate degree in Biological and Agricultural Engineering. Her research focus was augmenting the water conservation benefits of rainwater harvesting systems with stormwater management benefits through innovative design and operation strategies. Kathy completed her PhD in summer 2013 and joined Longwood University’s department of Biological and Environmental Sciences as an Assistant Professor in August 2013. Stormwater Solutions and Services, LLC was also founded in 2013, allowing Kathy to continue her private consulting interests in a more professional setting.</p>
